# BLOG SITE: NEXTJS

## This is a little of a learning project.
I made this project in order to learn about nextjs, from its installation to its features and working with next js.

I used tailwind css for designing. 
For the informations written, I read from nextjs.org documentations and took help from chatGPT as resources for documenting everything. 
Screenshots included are used by me whilst creating "next" project in my local machine.

## Do read documentations mentioned in my blog 'website' for Next js from installations to starting project.
