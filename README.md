# BLOG SITE: NEXTJS

## This is a little of a learning project.
I made this project in order to learn nextjs, from its installation process to its features and working with it.

I used tailwind css for designing. 

For documenting this blog page, I read everything from 'nextjs.org' documentation and took help from chatGPT as resources. 
Screenshots included are used by me whilst leraning and creating "nextjs" project on my local machine.
